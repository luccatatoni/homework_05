# Homework_05

####  This homework  asked us to i)build a personal finance planner to allow visualization of savings composed by investments and shares and ii) build a retirement tool by running a Monte Carlo Simulation using a portfolio of Stocks (SPY) and Bonds (AGG) to project the performance at 30 years.

#### - The output of this first section suggested that savings reached the goal of emergency funds, but the fact that cryptos are taken into account of that is debatable due to volatility. 

#### - The output of the second section allowed us to view the expected returns of a portfolio of Stocks and Bonds. The results are shown below:

- There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $20,000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $90,859.31 and $1,347,259.55

- There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $30,000 in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of $136,288.97 and $2,020,889.33
